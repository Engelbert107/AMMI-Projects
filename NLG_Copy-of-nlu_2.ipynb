John Rupert Firth, a 20th century linguist, inspired this line of work when he said \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\" That is, let's try to infer something about semantics from the distributional statistics of how words are used in context.\n","\n","Early work on [distributional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics) involved clustering words together with similar distributional statistics. The widely used [Brown clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_clustering), developed at IBM by Peter Brown in the early 1990s, produces a hierarchical clustering directly from data with some similarity to the Wordnet hierarchy produced by hand.\n","\n","Here, we'll take a step past clusters and start exploring **word embeddings** -- learned mappings of words to continuous vectors. Embedding space allows us to compute the distance between words (in Euclidean space) while preserving the nuance that differentiates synonyms (this nuance is lost in a clustering). Embeddings directly address the sparsity problem with language -- rather than parameterize all of the language with a sparse set of atomic words (or word n-grams), we parameterize it in a single, shared, fairly low dimensional space -- say 100 dimensions. So instead of a million words, we have 100 semantic axes.\n","\n","This notebook starts to address the problem of learning a mapping from words to vectors, an idea that has become the foundation to just about all modern NLU. At a high level, we'll achieve this by estimating vectors for each word that allow us to reconstruct a large matrix of co-occurrence counts across a corpus."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"N12fKP93-u2u"},"source":["## Setup\n","\n","Let's get started with the imports needed for the rest of this lab.\n","\n","We'll also need to load some utility functions which will help us work with the corpus."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FukClYGiSJHS"},"source":["### Imports\n","\n","Run this code cell to add in all of the imports."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"98ILZ3Vb5IBe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622685602632,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":2462,"user":{"displayName":"Engelbert Tchinde Wamba","photoUrl":"","userId":"14616578628350736220"}}},"source":["from __future__ import division\n","import itertools\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import nltk\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import re\n","import scipy.sparse\n","import time\n","\n","from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\n","from sklearn.manifold import TSNE as tsne"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e0HkdNBz-zYk"},"source":["### bAbI task corpus reader\n","\n","Start by running the cell below to load the corpus reader."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wQNZzQ-p-qne","cellView":"form","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622685617620,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":293,"user":{"displayName":"Engelbert Tchinde Wamba","photoUrl":"","userId":"14616578628350736220"}}},"source":["#@title bAbI Task corpus reader\n","import sys, os\n","import glob\n","import re\n","from collections import namedtuple\n","\n","# Struct types for different lines in the bAbI dataset.\n","# StoryLine represents \"ID text\" lines as (int, string)\n","# QALine represents \"ID question answer support\" lines as\n","# (int, string, string, list(int)).\n","# If tokenized, string fields can be replaced with list(string).\n","StoryLine = namedtuple(\"StoryLine\", [\"id\", \"text\"])\n","QALine = namedtuple(\"QALine\", [\"id\", \"question\", \"answer\", \"support_ids\"])\n","\n","class BabiTaskCorpusReader(object):\n","    \"\"\"Corpus reader for the bAbI tasks dataset.\n","\n","    See https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/ for details.\n","\n","    This class exposes a similar interface to NLTK's corpus readers, and should\n","    be interchangable with them in many applications.\n","\n","    Example usage:\n","\n","    import babi_utils\n","    import nltk\n","    tok = nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordTokenizer()\n","    cr = babi_utils.BabiTaskCorpusReader(\"/home/babi/en\",\n","                                         tokenizer=tok.tokenize)\n","    words = list(cr.words())\n","    print words[:8]\n","    #

simple co-occurrences in a text corpus and SVD to create dense embeddings -- representations for words that appear to preserve some of our intuitions about word similarities. A few questions naturally come to mind:\n","\n","* **Is there some way to *interpret* each dimension of the embeddings?**\n","Well, no, not really. Because the embeddings arise solely from their distributional properties, we can't guarantee that each dimension will correspond to some intuitive concept. Of course you could try to examine the 2-D plot (not the t-SNE one) and see if you can find an explanation for the first two components -- the $x$ and $y$ axes. Note that some social science disciplines like psychology have used **Factor Analysis** to attempt to rotate embeddings into a pre-defined space with psychological concepts on the axes. But typically in language processing, we simply relinquish control over the inferred semantics.\n","\n","\n","* **How do we evaluate how *good* the embeddings are?**\n","Evaluation typically comes in two forms: **intrinsic** and **extrinsic**. Intrinsic evaluation attempts to quantify the quality of the embeddings themselves. A few different annotation projects have attempted to score semantic similarity between pairs of words by averaging human judgements (e.g. see [ConceptSim](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hansens/conceptSim/)). So we could ask how well distances between our word embeddings correlate with human judgements. Another related evaluation involves analogies. Can we use Euclidean distances in embeddings space to solve fill-in-the-blanks like: `[man::woman as king::_____]`, which can capture various kinds of syntactic and semantic relationships? See [Chen, Peterson, Griffiths, 2017](https://cocosci.berkeley.edu/papers/vector_space_analogy_cogsci2017_final.pdf) for a lot more details and a cognitive science perspective. By contrast, extrinsic evaluation involves plugging the embeddings into another task and measuring relative improvements.\n","\n","As it turns out, the co-occurrence plus SVD method is simple, but inferior with respect to both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. The Word2Vec ideas introduced in the next notebook revolutionized language processing by dramatically improving embeddings."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"F2BxDqtDSiJF"},"source":["## Experiments\n","\n","(1) Compute the 5 nearest neighbors in our induced 25-dimensional embeddings space for each of the following words:\n","`[\"john\", \"kitchen\", \"give\", \"mouse\", \"she\", \"blue\"]`. Do the results look reasonable? Is this intrinsic or extrinsic evaluation?\n","\n","(2) Train your embeddings using a real corpus of text. This could be some text you have access to, e.g. some text from Wikipedia, or Shakespeare. You just need to load a corpus of sentences, which you can do by specifying its pathname as the first argument to the BabiTaskCorpusReader function."]}]}
